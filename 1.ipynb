    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing the essential features and behavior of an object or system while hiding unnecessary details. It involves creating abstract classes and interfaces that provide a simplified and generalized representation of objects, allowing the users to interact with them without needing to know the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction helps in managing complexity by breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable components and allowing the users to work with high-level concepts rather than dealing with low-level details. It promotes code modularity, reusability, and maintainability by encapsulating the complexity and providing a clean interface for interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain both abstract and concrete methods. An abstract method is a method declared in the abstract class but does not have an implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide implementations for the abstract methods."
